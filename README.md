# iSamplr 

A soundboard app for iOS (iPad). _shh, it's a working title._

## Overview
iSamplr (working title) is an iPad app that allows the user to load a sound file, or record a sound clip using internal microphone of iPad (or headphones with microphones designed to work with iOS devices). The main goal of the app is to allow entry- to amateur-level DJs to produce music using the sampled sounds that are bound to each button. An example of its advanced usage is [Girl Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glbgOGRdWB0), and [the Glitch Mob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WImWuxHbQCw).
